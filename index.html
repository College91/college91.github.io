        <p>All three are shonen series, which usually focus on topics such as adventure, growth, and action. This genre normally has a lot of subplots and one main, overarching plot. Fighting is also a main part of most shonen series: the protagonists almost always have a superpower and are very muscle headed in nature.</p>
